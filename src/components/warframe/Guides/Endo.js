        <p>Ever tried to upgrade your mods and ran into the problem that you didnt have enough endo?(edited)</p>

        <p>
            Well, there are different solutions for this Problem. You can, for example
            farm raw endo in mission from enemies or rotational rewards or extracting
            endo from sculptures. ->Keep in mind: these are just examples and there
            are more ways to get endo.
        </p>
        <p>
            Allow me to show you 1 guaranteed way to obtain a ayatan sculpture.
            You are probably wondering, what are ayatan sculptures even?(edited)
            Lets take the description of the warframe wiki to give you a rough idea:
        </p>
        <div className='darkened'>
            Ayatan Sculptures are ancient Orokin treasures powered by Endo that can be
            discovered across the system. There are two types available: the Sculptures
            themselvеs, and smaller Stars which can be inserted into the larger
            Sculptures to increase their value. These can be traded to Maroo at her
            Bazaar for varying amounts of Endo, or placed within the Orbiter as
            decorations.
        </div>
        <p>
            You are probably thinking „I can run around different missions and turn
            those things in for endo to upgrade my mods? HOOK ME UP!“
        </p>
        <p>
            One way of aquiring those sculptures in a guaranteed manner ist the
            "Weekly Ayatan Treasure Hunt"-Quest offered by Maroo on Mars. What
            follows is a description of 1 way to access this quest and completing it.
            ->Keep in mind: This quest resets every monday at 00:00 UTC.(edited)
            Step 1: Open up your navigation and click on Mars and click on Maroo's
            Bazaar Relay or choose the Weekly Alert from your Alert Page @
            Navigation
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/479324110430928902/Guide1.png' />
        <p>
            Step 2: You will enter a derelict relay and search for a NPC called "Maroo"
            and talk with her.
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/479324764012544010/Guide2.PNG' />
        <p>
            Step 3: You will see a dialog with different options. For now we will only
            concentrate on the highlighted one. Once you click it, you will queue up for
            a mission "Treasure Hunt"
            ->the marker will show you the way to the Artifact (the sculpture), proceed
            to the target!(
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/479325572573429760/Guide4.PNG' />
        <p>
            once you arrive at the target you will be confronted with the treasure
            room, be careful this room is full of traps and obstacles and you need to
            proceed fast since its time gated
        </p>
        <p>
            Step 4: Complete the treasure room, a good way to train this is doing
            normal void missions and doing them there. A example is shown here by
            myself with the help of @GhostWolf's account because my own recording
            was broken. (A new recording will follow at a later point)
        </p>
        <p>
            example is shown with frost, since he is a "slower" frame. other frames
            might make it easier, you can also use Titanias Razorwing Mode to cheese
            the challenge.
            Once you aquired the sculpture (dont forget to press x!) proceed to
            extraction.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finished! The quest is done and you got your Ayatan Sculpture.

            Inserting Ayatan Stars into Ayatan Sculptures and then extracting the endo
        </h5>
        <p>
            Now that we got the treasure we gotta know what to do with it.
            Step 1: Go to your mod console in your landing craft
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/479350073864618005/Ayatan1.PNG' />
        <p>
            Step 2: Enter the Ayatan Treasures sub menu like highlighted in the pic.
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/479350585959907338/Ayatan2.PNG' />
        <p>
            Step 3: Once you enter the sub menu you will see 3 different items for
            now. 1. Ayatan Amber Star, a rare ayatan treasure that drops from
            enemies and storage in missions. 2. Ayatan Ayr Sculpture ->Keep in mind:
            There are different sculpture with different values. 3. Ayatan Cyan Star, a
            relative common ayatan treasure that drops from enemies and storage in
            missions.
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/479353074314510346/Ayatan3.PNG' />
        <p>
            Step 4: Click on the sculpturek, you will notice 2 things
            Click on the different holes on the sculpture to install stars, as seen in the
            next picture
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/479353323460362240/Ayatan4.PNG' />
        <p>
            the endo value will increase the more stars you install. Do not sell the
            sculpture before its filled.
        </p>

        <p>
            Step 5 ?: You can now put it on your ship as decoration OR (see Step 6)

            Step 6: Extract (sell) the sculpture of/for endo! For this we will have to
            return to maroo's bazaar and talk with Maroo. Click the highlighted option:

        <p>
            Step 7: Select the scuplture or sculptures you want to sell(edited)
            -> Keep in mind to select the sculpture you filled with stars!
        </p>

        <p>
            and sell it for endo!
        </p>
        <p>
            Finished! We got the endo, now we can proceed to the mod console and
