        <h4>Relic And Fissures Guide</h4>
        <p>
            This guide will contain 4 stages: stage 1: How
            to get relics stage 2: How to use the relics stage 3: What fissures are and
            reward picking stage 4: How to find out where to get what you
            want
        </p>
        <p>
            Stage 1 So to begin you have to get a relic.
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/481793607238549505/1..PNG' />
        <p>
            The best way to get a relic is by going into missions that drop them. Most
            missions will have a relic as a reward in the mission. But if you want to get
            a certain item from a relic you will have to find that out via the internet
            (more on stage 4). Sometimes you wont always get a relic from the
            missions as it is chance based. So finding out where to get the most relics
            per mission is usually better (by asking clan members or searching it up).
        </p>
        <p>
            Stage 2 So now when you have relic(s) you can begin using them. What
            you have to do to begin with is go to the navigation.
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/481793981223665674/2..PNG' />
        <p>
            Then if you look up to the right there is a couple of icons. One of those
            icons look like a swirly fire.
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/481794053244190720/3..PNG' />
        <p>
            That icon is the icon for fissures. Fissures are kinda like alerts where you
            have to go into a mission. However its a bit different. Depending on if you
            go for Lith, Meso, Neo and Axi you will have to bring the corresponding
            relic types. Now to start. So if you start the mission and go in there is
            noticeable diffrences. To begin with there is 0/10 on the middle top with
            the swirly fire icon.
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/481794148198907914/4..PNG' />
        <p>
            This represents how many reactants you have picked up. Reactant is the
            thing that will allow you to get your relic opened.
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/481794170499891200/5..png' />
        <p>
            If you do not have 10/10 reactant you wont open your relic. And wont get
            the reward in the relic. You will however still keep your unopened relic so
            you can try again. Reactant drops from enemies affected by the fissures
            (see more on stage 3) and enemies from the void that will jump out of
            these fissures. So if you want to get reactant you either have to wait for
            them to get affected by the fissures or get some other enemies that
            already are (usually just killing everything will give you enough reactants
            anyway).
        </p>
        <p>
            Stage 3 Fissures are basically rifts from the orokin void into the normal
            world.
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/481794356257226772/6..png' />
        <p>
            Void Fissures will appear along the mission objective path, spawning in
            Corrupted units from the Void as well as converting nearby native enemies
            into Corrupted units.
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/481794369548976139/7..PNG' />
        <p>
            Now for when you have completed the mission and collected all the
            reactants you need you can (if you are in a squad (which is highly
            recommended)) choose between the rewards of your squad members and
            your own.
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/481794495168380928/8..PNG' />
        <p>
            If you dont know what to get from the rewards you usually want to go for
            what you wanted first, then if you have trouble choosing just get the rarest
            of them based on the color and otherwise just choose anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stage 4 Now you know how to get, use and collect whats in a relic. Now
            you probably want to know a bit on how to get that nice prime weapon you
            have been hearing about. Well the best way is to search on the internet.
            This stage will mostly just give links to those helpful sites that you can use
            to find out. On this you can use ctrl + f and search for what prime part you
            want and then find out what the relic is called and such.<a href='http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Void_Relic/DropLocationsByRelic'>HERE</a>
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/481794663787790356/9..PNG' />
        <p>
            So depending on the percentage of the relic dropping on certain mission
            type you can find out what mission type is the best. Also make sure you
            see what the category it is and what rotation.
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/481794716237824003/10..PNG' />
        <p>
            And when you have you can click on the link on the mission type you can
            find out what planet and mission you have to go to if you want to get the
            relic. Example:http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Capture To do that you have
            to go lower down the page and find the rewards tab.
        </p>
        <img alt='' src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479319972607426560/481794809116229632/11..PNG' />
        <p>
            You have to click on the category that was on the mission when you looked
            at the relics. Once you find that you can look on the bottom of the tab
            what planets and missions have that category of rewards.
        </p>

            The End :D
